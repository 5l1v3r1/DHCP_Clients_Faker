DHCP_Clients_Faker
==================

Script to generate a number of Fake DHCP Clients on a network. Will complete a
DHCP "four-way handshake" and then be done. Never issues a release for the
address.

Interface must be in promiscuous mode.

Provide a number of clients to run with. You can add --fork to for each instance
of a client running.
